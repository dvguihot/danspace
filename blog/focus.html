<h3 id="intro">intro</h3>
<p>being part of western gen-z cohort, the societal expectation is to
live a digital life—to share every experience on instagram, to get news
from youtube, to entertain ourselves on tiktok, to purchase everything
from amazon, to sink hours into the latest video game, you get the
point. it’s how most of us live, yet rarely do we reflect upon the
consequences of such a lifestyle. further, given that our friends and
family (and everyone around us) are digitally united, we are expected to
do the same.</p>
<p>often times we act without thinking of consequences. we are slaves to
our emotional desires. we forgo long-term thinking, and instead choose
to listen to our emotive taskmasters, constantly chasing the next
dopamine hit, the next new product, the newest release of x, finding
ourself yet longing for y, not knowing we needed z. this masochistic
cycle is what drives the lifestyles of nearly gen-z person. while it’s
part of human nature to desire, it’s a problem when these feelings get
conflated for value. the question then becomes—what brings value?
currently, within our shallow existences, it’s a rare discussion that
seems to have been lost between generations.</p>
<h3 id="why">why</h3>
<p>gen-z, the distracted generation, the vain generation, the connected
generation, the indulgent generation, this is the generation that will
soon run society. being part of this generation, I can give an internal
look, discuss the reasons why my generation is novel, and discuss the
extrapolations of the consequences of our individual actions.</p>
<p>why do we live like this? why are we expected to live like this? how
did we end up like this?—being a part of the anxious generation, just
thinking of these questions often spurs anxiety within myself. these are
important questions. they’re difficult to answer, yet we have to try. if
we can’t understand the reasoning behind our behavior, it becomes
impossible to adjust ourselves for a better life. in my opinion, there’s
a few reasons we’ve ended up like this.</p>
<h3 id="value">value</h3>
<p>chasing value is something humans have done for a <em>long</em> time.
meaning is something gen-z is lacking. we are comfortable, pampered, and
don’t understand suffering. our lives have been so easy, we are
uncomfortable with any sort of pain. what’s unique about this
generation, is our unprecedented access to distraction.</p>
<p>nihilism is the philosophical basis driving our lifestyles. as
religion becomes increasingly unpopular, the typical goals that drove
our predecessors has been lost (as well as our moral drives). because of
this, it’s difficult to find a guiding light in the current world. what
should we chase after?—given there is no intrinsic meaning to life
anyway (according to nihilism).</p>
<h3 id="the-search---finding-a-balanced-lifestyle">the search - finding
a balanced lifestyle</h3>
<p>is it possible to live in the connected world—whilst choosing a
focused lifestyle? these two seemingly dimorphic lifestyles seem to
clash, each valuing different ideals differently. should we live like
luddites, regressing 200 years, choosing atechnology to any technology?
conversely, we could choose to live as we do, constantly connected,
constantly stimulated, constantly shallow.</p>
