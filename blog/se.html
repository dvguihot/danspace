<p><em>hey, if you’re wondering why someone might be inclined to live
with a dumbphone, checkout this post that I wrote.</em></p>
<h3 id="intro">intro</h3>
<p>there is no question that smartphones are a deeply ingrained piece of
technology in modern society, with recent generations not even being
aware of other types of phone. its constant connection to the internet
and ability to provide us with information at a moments notice captured
our collective attention, making its way into the hands of billions of
people. however, in an age where the internet has become an auctionhouse
of attention, it can be hard to find a moment where you arent checking
your notifications or scrolling a feed.</p>
<p>being a new member to the dumbphone community, I wanted to share my
experiences with my second-hand iphone se, as well as detail the various
pros and cons of living with such a device.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-dumbphone">what is a dumbphone?</h3>
<p>in order to define a dumphone, you must first examine the qualities
of a smartphone that are generally seen as harmful:</p>
<ul>
<li>allows the installation of social media platforms, such as
instagram, facebook, or twitter</li>
<li>a large form factor with a high refresh-rate display and colour
functionalities (touch screen)</li>
</ul>
<p>therefore a dumbphone must align with the opposite:</p>
<ul>
<li>simply does communications (text and call) - apps such as whatsapp
are fine</li>
<li>small form factor</li>
<li>limited internet browsing capabilities</li>
<li>limited storage</li>
</ul>
<p>in other words, ‘an dumbphone’ is a device that disregards the
entertainment aspects of a smartphone yet focuses on the utilitarian
functionality in order to be more present and focused.</p>
<p>there are a lot of people who buy a fliphone/candybar and end up
installing instagram/tiktok and other apps on it and say they have a
dumbphone, or at the minimum a digital detox phone. this, imo, defeats
the whole purpose of having a dumbphone, as the entertainment aspects of
smartphones are reintroduced. an android phone with only minimal apps
would be more of a dumbphone than a cat s22 with tiktok on it.</p>
<h3 id="my-phone">my phone</h3>
<p>since i am a new member of the dumbphone community, i decided it
would be best to implement a ‘transition’ device, or a semi-dumbphone in
order to ease the switch. when deciding what device to buy, i had
carrier restrictions in mind, due to the recent shutdown of 3G networks
in australia, limiting my choices to recent-ish releases. price was also
a factor that i had to consider, as spending $100+ on a telephone seemed
too expensive.</p>
<p>after considering all my choices, i bought a used 2016 iphone se,
where i removed most apps that were necessary or un-deleteable, leaving
phone, text, camera, and itunes the only apps on the homescreen. despite
this, the device still had some internet connectivity and a colourful
touchscreen, re-enabling a few negative tropes of the traditional
smartphone. avoiding these features was easy enough though.</p>
<h3 id="why">why</h3>
<p>i want to be more conscious of my use of digital devices, as ive
started to notice the detrimental impact that constant stimulation has
had on my ability to think properly. it was destroying my self-image and
mental health, yet i would still spend hours everyday lying in bed,
scrolling the endless treadmill of content that was served to me.</p>
<p>fortunately, i was able to cut the addiction and stop consuming all
the short form content that i would usually spend a massive chunk of my
day wasting on. almost immediately, i felt urges to reinstall my
favourite apps and reconnect with my friends. to help, i decided to
split the use of my technology, namely using a paper diary for
organisation and dates, a separate laptop for storing and ripping cds
(which i would then upload select albums to my phone), and a camera. if
i want to take my camera to take a picture outside i will not be
distracted by a notification on a screen of an useless app and spend 10
min on the app that sent me the notification and finally forget what i
was doing in the first place.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion-and-recommendations">conclusion and
recommendations</h3>
<p>recommending the focused lifestyle in general is difficult, choosing
to life a life disconnected can feel isolating, and explaining your
choices to others is often an undertaking in itself. further,
recommending any dumbphone is difficult—they can be buggy, often don’t
work well globally, and are occasionally difficult to track down.
however, i can wholly recommend taking the initiative to switch.</p>

<p>for anyone looking to join, the dumbphone finder is useful for
filtering dumbphones. it has some mistakes so double check the device
before purchase</p>
